# Agent Journey Replay (DVR)

## Project Description
The **Agent Journey Replay (DVR)** project provides a tool to visualize an agent's actions during a customer service interaction on the Empath platform. This tool captures and replays each action taken by the agent, offering stakeholders a detailed view of the interaction. The replay process is fully automated, requiring no manual input. To ensure privacy and protect sensitive information, the tool uses mock data instead of real data. Playwright is utilized for frontend automation, allowing seamless and accurate playback of the agent's actions. This project facilitates the review of agent interactions while maintaining data security and integrity.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others who will 
follow in your footsteps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the development of this project.
